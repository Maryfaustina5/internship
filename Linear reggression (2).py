# Check out these four linear regression plots: 
# 
# 
# Which one represents an underfitted model?
# a)The bottom-left plot
# b) The top-right plot
# c) The bottom-right plot
# d) The top-left plot
# 
# Answer: c) The bottom-right plot.

# There are five basic steps when you‚Äôre implementing linear regression:
# ‚Ä¢ a. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
# ‚Ä¢ b. Provide data to work with, and eventually do appropriate transformations.
# ‚Ä¢ c. Apply the model for predictions.
# ‚Ä¢ d. Import the packages and classes that you need.
# ‚Ä¢ e. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
# However, those steps are currently listed in the wrong order. What‚Äôs the correct order
# 
# Answer: the correct order is: d, b, e, a, c.
